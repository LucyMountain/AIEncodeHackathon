Lending
You lend your crypto to others, usually through a platform in exchange for earning interest (which is a return amount that you have to pay back).
Works similar to bank saving account but with higher potential return, but also a higher risk.
Borrowers often put up collateral ( a valuable asset as a pledge as a security for a loan) to reduce default risk.

Staking
You lock up your crypto, usually a proof-of-stake token like ETH or SOL, to help secure a blockchain network.
In return you earn rewards, like interest, over time.
Similar to earning dividends(Profit pay-outs to shareholders) for helping run the system.

Yield farming
You move your crypto between different DeFi platforms to chase  the highest returns.
Often involves  staking or lending tokens to earn interest and extra token rewards.
Higher return	 usually  come with higher risk and complexity.

DEX LP
You provide two tokens to a decentralised exchange(like Uniswap:place to trade crypto without a middleman) to help users trade.
You earn a share of the trading fees, but risk losses if token prices shift too much (impermanent loss).
It's like being a mini market-marker on  a crypto exchange.

Stable-coin Yield
You can earn interest by depositing stable-coins(cryptos tied to the  dollar, like USDC or DAI).
This strategy is often low-risk because stable-coins don't fluctuate like regular crypto.
Returns can come from lending, staking, or providing liquidity with stable-coins.

Vault strategy
Smart contract that automatically invests crypto using a specific strategy (like lending or yield farming).
It's like putting your money in a robo-advisor for DeFi.
Designed to maximise  yield while automating complex tasks for the user.

Auto Yield Aggregator
These platforms automatically find  and switch to the best DeFi returns for your crypto.
The "farm the farmers" by pooling users funds and rotating them to the most profitable strategies.
Great for hands-off users who want optimised passive income.
